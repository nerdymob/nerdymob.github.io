                <h3>
                    <a href="https://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    CNN is a news website. The primary purpose is to provide relevant and recent information. This is achieved through a series of articles and links. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast</li>
                        <p>
                            Minimal contrast. Looks like a wall of text, apart from the articles with large pictures. 
                        </p>
                    <li>Repetition</li>
                        <p>
                            No consistant behavior in the website until you reach the section of ADs. Large margins that are consistant throughout the page. 
                        </p>
                    <li>Alignment</li>
                        <p>
                            Alignment follows many paths. This is seen in 3-section areas, yet falls apart near instantly to a conglomerate mess.  
                        </p>
                    <li>Proximity</li>
                        <p>
                            Minimal distance between each section of information. This is supposed to allow more information to be tightly packed and easily accessable; yet it makes information harder to reach.  
                        </p>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>
                    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Microsoft is a technology company. They provide technology such as computers along with resourses to other forms of technology. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast</li>
                        <p>
                            Information is easily presented due to a white background and off-white for information sections. This contrast is just enough to be noticible while not straining the eyes. 
                        </p>
                    <li>Repetition</li>
                        <p>
                            There is a logical flow through the website, guiding the user through each section. 
                        </p>
                    <li>Alignment</li>
                        <p>
                            Each section is set with proper alignment of 4 columns. Each column has information organized alongside the other sections. 
                        </p>
                    <li>Proximity</li>
                        <p>
                            Each section of information has enough sace to dictate that they are seperate information while still being relevant to each other section. This includes columns and rows to sub conciously tell the user which information is relative to them. 
                        </p>
                </ul>
