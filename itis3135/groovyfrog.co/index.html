        Here at Groovy Frog, we design cool stuff such as websites for local community. In doing so, we have made many friends and are glad to have made such progress
        in such a short amount of time. This progress can be attributed to the many people who are guiding us each day. Professors, Mentors, and certainly our friends
        who support us daily. 
      </p>

        Thank you for your continued support, and remember to stay Groovy! ~ Groovy Frog Co.
