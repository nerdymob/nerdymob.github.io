        My name is Kimber. I am a 28 year old artist based in Gastonia, North Carolina. 
          I primarily produce fan art for a variety of different anime, cartoons, games, and movies.
          I began my artistic journey when I was really young, and have spent fifteen years honing my skills to create the type of art that I always dreamed I could make. 
          I make prints in small batches, and design t-shirts and stickers. I tour anime conventions throughout the state with my sister and we sell our art together. 
          Check my commissions page for pricing of custom pieces. I hope you enjoy my work!
